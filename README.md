## Contributing

The font is developing in the FontForge application, which generally works in all Windows and Unix kernels.

The FontForge project is a file terminating with the **.s1fd.sfd** extension and the filename starts with **project-** followed by a number. For example:

* **project-1**.s1fd.sfd

These project files are eventually uploaded to this repository.

### Contributing to in FontForge

* [ ] Shapes are initially built as segment paths (partial shapes)
* [ ] After a partial shape is complete, select all of its points and select <kbd>Element > Expand Stroke</kbd> and expand stroke by Major Axis (width) = 128 and Minor Axis (height) = 128 and Nib Angle = 45.
* [ ] Close shapes in the clockwise orientation, but subtraction ones in counterclockwise orientation.
* [ ] You may want to round the coordinates to an integer by selecting all points and clicking <kbd>Element > Round > To Int</kbd>, solving the "Non-uniform coordinates" problem.
* [ ] Keep in mind that one character generally spans two vertical rectangles located at the center of the canvas: the top rectangle is fat and the bottom rectangle is small.
